##EasyPack Maven Plugin

EasyPack is a Maven plugin that facilitates the distribution of Java applications in **tar**, **zip** and **tar.gz** formats.

The plugin introduces three new packaging types for using instead of the standard jar and war options. The final artifact is a tar, zip or tar.gz archive that includes the java application.

The pom will look like:

``` xml                            
              <groupId>org.company</groupId>
              <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
              <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT<version>
              <packaing> jtar </packaging>
```                                
``` xml                            
              <groupId>org.company</groupId>
              <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
              <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT<version>
              <packaing> jzip </packaging>
```  

``` xml                            
              <groupId>org.company</groupId>
              <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
              <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT<version>
              <packaing> jtargz </packaging>
```  

### Features

* _**Java applications in tar, zip or tar.gz**_: the final artifact is in tar, zip or tar.gz format.

* _**Start script creation**_: start scripts for linux and/or windows are automatically created.

* _**Dependency management**_: the project dependencies are automatically included in the final artifact.

* _**No deploy of useless artifacts**_: the jar or war file generated by the standard packagings, is not deployed in the Maven repository as only one artifact, in the required format, is created.
